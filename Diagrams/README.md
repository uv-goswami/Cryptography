## Key Life Cycle

Key Life Cycle describes all phases a cryptographic key goes through—from creation to destruction and replacement—to ensure secure handling and minimize risk.

## Key Generation

Key Generation is the process of creating cryptographic keys using high-quality randomness and defined algorithms. These keys become the foundation for all encryption, signing, and authentication operations.

# Key Storage

Key Storage is the process of safely holding cryptographic keys over their entire lifecycle so they remain confidential, intact, and available only to authorized components.

# Key Distribution

Key Distribution is the process of securely delivering cryptographic keys from their point of generation to the authorized recipients. It guarantees that only intended parties receive the correct key material without tampering or interception.

### Key Destruction  

Key Destruction is the process of completely and irreversibly removing cryptographic key material from all storage and backup locations so that it cannot be recovered or misused.
