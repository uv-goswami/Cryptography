# ✍️ Cryptographic Signatures

Cryptographic signatures are foundational primitives in security protocols. They ensure authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of digital messages and transactions. This document outlines various signature types, their schemes, properties, infrastructure, and applications.

## 🔐 Digital Signatures

Digital signatures bind a message to a sender using asymmetric cryptography. They are widely used in secure communication, software distribution, and identity verification.

### 🔧 Schemes

- **RSA**: Based on integer factorization; widely used in PKI and TLS.
- **DSA**: Uses discrete logarithms; standardized for government use.
- **ECDSA**: Elliptic curve variant of DSA; efficient and secure for constrained devices.
- **EdDSA**: Modern, deterministic signature scheme using Edwards curves; used in Signal, OpenSSH.

### 🧩 Properties

- **Authenticity**: Verifies the origin of the message.
- **Integrity**: Ensures the message has not been altered.
- **Non-repudiation**: Prevents the sender from denying authorship.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure

- **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**: Manages public keys and certificates.
- **Public Key**: Used for verification.
- **Private Key**: Used for signing.

### 📦 Applications

- TLS/SSL
- Software Signing
- Email Security (S/MIME, PGP)

## 🧮 Threshold Signatures

Threshold signatures allow a subset of parties (t-of-n) to collaboratively generate a valid signature without revealing individual keys.

### 🔑 Key Generation

- **Distributed Keygen**: Joint key generation without a trusted dealer.
- **Shamir Secret Sharing**: Splits a secret into shares; any t shares can reconstruct it.

### ✍️ Signing

- **t-of-n Parties**: Only t participants are needed to produce a valid signature.
- **MPC-Based**: Uses secure multi-party computation to generate signatures.

### ✅ Verification

- **Single Verifier**: Signature appears as if generated by a single entity.
- **Aggregated Signature**: Combines multiple partial signatures into one.

### 📦 Applications

- Blockchain Consensus (e.g., Algorand, Dfinity)
- Secure MPC
- Custodial Wallets (multi-sig)

## 🧠 Advanced Signatures

These schemes extend traditional signatures with privacy, anonymity, or efficiency enhancements.

### 🕵️ Ring Signatures

- **Property**: Anonymity—signer is hidden among a group.
- **Application**: Monero (private transactions)

### 👥 Group Signatures

- **Property**: Traceability and revocation—group manager can reveal signer.
- **Application**: Anonymous authentication in voting, corporate access

### 🙈 Blind Signatures

- **Property**: Privacy—signer cannot see the message being signed.
- **Application**: E-Cash, anonymous credentials

### ⚡ Aggregate Signatures

- **Property**: Efficiency—multiple signatures compressed into one.
- **Application**: BLS (used in Ethereum 2.0, threshold schemes)

## 🧪 Post-Quantum Signatures

Designed to resist attacks from quantum computers. These schemes are part of NIST’s post-quantum cryptography standardization.

### 🔐 Categories

- **Lattice-Based**: Based on hard lattice problems (e.g., Dilithium, Falcon)
- **Hash-Based**: Uses Merkle trees and hash functions (e.g., SPHINCS+)
- **Multivariate**: Based on solving multivariate polynomial equations

### 📦 Applications

- Quantum-Safe Messaging
- Firmware Signing
- Blockchain Identity Layers
