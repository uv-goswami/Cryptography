# Key
Cryptographic Key is a string of bits that is used to encrypt and decrypt data.
**Purpose**
* Encyprtion: Convert plaintext to unreadable ciphertext.
* Decryption: Convert ciphertext back to plaintext.
* Signing: Verify that the message came from trusted source and was not altered.
* Verification: Confirm the digital signature is Valid.


# Encryption
## Symmetric Encryption:
  - Uses a single, shared key for encryption and decryption.
  - Algorithms include AES, DES, RC4.
  - Pros:
    1. fast
    2. efficient
    3. Secure
  - Cons:
    1. Key Distribution is a problem
    2. Can't scale.
    3. If even one system is exposed, all communication is compromised.
  - Applications:
    1. Encrypted email and File Storage
    2. Full-disk encryption
    3. Data at rest protection in databases and cloud storage.

### Block Ciphers: 
  Block ciphers encrypt data in fixed size blocks(eg, 128 bits) by applying deterministic algorithm and secret key to each block independently. 

| Cipher | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** | The most widely used block cipher today; known for strong security and efficiency; supports 128-, 192-, and 256-bit keys. |
| **DES (Data Encryption Standard)** | An older block cipher using 56-bit keys; considered insecure due to small key size and vulnerabilities. |
**Applications:** VPNs, disk encryption(eg, Bitlocker), TLS, secure messaging

### Stream Ciphers: 
  Stream Ciphers encrypt data one bit/byte at a time by combining with plaintext with a pseudorandom number. 
   Cipher | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ChaCha20** | A modern, fast, and secure stream cipher often used in TLS and mobile applications. It is designed to be efficient on software platforms. |
| **RC4** | Once widely used but now deprecated due to multiple security vulnerabilities. |

**Applications:** VPNs, disk encryption, TLS, secure messaging.

### Message Authentication Codes (MACs):
  MACs a cryptographic checksums generated from the message and secret key to verify data intigrity and authenticity.

  | MAC Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **HMAC (Hash-based MAC)** | Combines a cryptographic hash function with a secret key; widely used in TLS, APIs, and digital signatures. |
| **CMAC (Cipher-based MAC)** | Uses block cipher algorithms (like AES) to generate authentication codes. |

Applications: Data integrity, API authentication, secure storage.

## Asymmetric Encryption:
  Uses a pair of keys, Public Key and Private Key, to encrypt and decrypt data.
  **Types of Keys**
    * Private Key: kept secret and is used for decryption or creating signatures/ signing a message.
    * Public key: shared openly and is used for encryption or verifying signatures.
  - Pros:
    1. No need to share the private key.
    2. Enables digital signatures.
  - Cons:
    1. Slower, Computationally heavy.
    2. Used for smaller data.
  - Applications:
    1. Secure Web Communtication(TLS/SSL)
    2. Email Signing
    3. Digital Signatures
    4. Blockchain: Bitcoin, Ethereum
    5. Secure Shell(SSH)
    6. Achieving Confidentiality, Digital Identity, Authentication, Intigrity
   
### üì¨ Public Key Encryption

| Scheme   | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **RSA**     | Based on integer factorization; used in PKI and TLS. |
| **ElGamal** | Based on discrete logarithms; supports homomorphic encryption. |

**Applications**: Secure messaging, key distribution, hybrid encryption.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Digital Signatures

| Scheme         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **ECDSA**        | Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm; efficient and secure. |
| **EdDSA**        | Deterministic, fast, modern signature scheme. |
| **RSA Signature**| Signature variant of RSA; used in software signing and certificates. |

**Applications**: Authentication, document signing, blockchain.

### üîÑ Key Exchange

| Protocol         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Diffie-Hellman** | Classic key exchange using discrete logs. |
| **ECDH**           | Elliptic curve variant; faster and more secure. |

**Applications**: TLS handshake, secure messaging, VPNs.
