### Sources of Entropy

| Source            | Description                                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TRNG (True RNG)   | Hardware-based randomness from physical phenomena (e.g., electronic noise) |
| PRNG (Pseudo RNG) | Software generator seeded by entropy to produce streams of random bits   |
| QRNG (Quantum RNG)| Quantum effects (e.g., photon behavior) supplying extremely high entropy |
| OS Facilities     | Built-in system calls (`/dev/random`, `getrandom()`, CryptGenRandom)     |

**Applications:**  
1. Seeding CSPRNGs for key material  
2. Generating nonces and salts in protocols  
3. Creating session keys in secure channels  

---

### Symmetric Key Generation

   - **RSA**: Pick two large random primes, compute n = p¬∑q, derive e/d exponents.  
   - **ECC**: Choose a random integer d in [1, n‚Äì1], compute public point Q = d¬∑G.  
3. Package keys in standard formats (PKCS#8, X.509, OpenSSH).  
4. Store private keys in secure vaults (HSM/TPM) and publish public keys or certificates.

| Algorithm     | Key Material Generated                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| RSA-2048      | 2048-bit modulus, public/private exponents   |
| ECDSA (P-256) | 256-bit private scalar and public point Q    |

# Key Storage

Key Storage is the process of safely holding cryptographic keys over their entire lifecycle so they remain confidential, intact, and available only to authorized components.

---
![KS](https://github.com/uv-goswami/Cryptography/blob/a29a2aef95acb2afada321985b4e760727f73938/Diagrams/Storage.drawio.svg)

---
**Objectives**

* Protect keys from unauthorized access or theft  
* Ensure keys are available when needed for cryptographic operations  
* Minimize exposure by limiting persistent copies  

---

## Storage Methods

| Method                        | Description                                                                 | Examples                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Software-Based Key Vaults     | Encrypted key stores managed by software services                           | HashiCorp Vault; Google Secret Manager     |
| Cloud Key Management Services | Managed services exposing key APIs with optional HSM backing                | AWS KMS; Azure Key Vault                   |
| Hardware Security Modules     | Dedicated hardware appliances and chips that generate and securely hold keys | HSM appliances; TPM chips                  |
| Processor-Isolated Enclaves   | CPU-enforced memory regions that protect keys from the OS and applications   | Intel SGX; ARM TrustZone                   |
| Ephemeral In-Memory Storage   | Session or ephemeral keys held in RAM or CPU registers, cleared on shutdown  | TLS session keys; ephemeral ECDH keys      |
| Threshold Cryptography        | Splits keys into shares and reconstructs them in memory when needed         | Shamir Secret Sharing; MPC protocols       |


---

## Memory & Cache Considerations

Keys in application memory and CPU caches/registers enable high-performance operations but are vulnerable if the host OS or hardware is compromised.  

To mitigate this risk:  

* Lock pages in RAM (e.g., `mlock`) to prevent swapping to disk  
* Use constant-time implementations to avoid cache-timing side-channels  
* Zero-ize buffers immediately after use to remove remnants  

Secure enclaves (SGX, TrustZone) provide hardware-enforced isolation so keys never leave protected memory regions, even if the OS is compromised.

---

## Key Backup & Recovery

Regularly back up encrypted key blobs (wrapped by a master key) to off-site or multi-region storage.  

Use secret-sharing to split backup keys across trustees or secure locations.  

Automate recovery drills to verify that keys can be restored under disaster scenarios.

---

## Key Access & Authorization

Enforce RBAC or ABAC policies to limit who can generate, read, wrap, or export keys.  

Log every key operation (generate, encrypt/decrypt, rotate, destroy) for audit and compliance.  

Use short-lived session keys derived from long-term master keys via HKDF to reduce long-term exposure.

---

## Advantages & Disadvantages

**Advantages**  
* Centralized vaults simplify policy enforcement and auditing  
* Hardware modules and enclaves resist software-level attacks  
* In-memory storage supports low-latency operations  

**Disadvantages**  
* Hardware modules add cost and integration complexity  
* In-memory keys risk leakage if the host is compromised  
* Vaultless or enclave solutions can be hard to scale across diverse environments

---

## Implementation Tips & Prerequisites

* Classify keys by sensitivity and choose storage accordingly (session vs. root keys)  
* For in-memory keys, enforce strict page locking and immediate zero-ization on release  
* Integrate Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or TPM for high-value key protection  
* Leverage managed KMS offerings for automated rotation, audit logging, and access control  
* Ensure code running in secure enclaves is minimal and audited to reduce attack surface

## Distribution Mechanisms

| Mechanism                   | Description                                                          | When to Use                                           | Examples                                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Manual Out-of-Band          | Physically transfer keys (USB, paper, QR code)                       | Small-scale, high-security scenarios                  | Hardware tokens; printed key cards       |
| Public Key Infrastructure   | Issue keys as certificates via trusted CAs                           | Enterprise systems; scalable identity management      | X.509 certificates in TLS/HTTPS          |

| Secure Remote Injection     | Inject keys into hardware modules over protected channels            | Device manufacturing; remote hardware onboarding      | TPM remote provisioning; Secure Boot APIs |

---

## Distribution Needed?

When no prior shared secret exists or automated renewal is required, dynamic distribution (KEM/KEX, API) is used.  

If distribution isn‚Äôt needed‚Äîbecause endpoints already share a secret or operate offline‚Äîyou use Pre-Shared Keys or local vault access instead.  

**Reasons to Skip Distribution**  
* Closed or air-gapped environments  
* Extremely resource-constrained devices  
* One-time provisioning scenarios  

---

## Security Properties

* Confidentiality: encrypt or wrap keys (AES key wrap, RSA-OAEP)  
* Integrity: include MACs or signatures to detect tampering  
* Authentication: mutual endpoint verification before acceptance  
* Replay Protection: use nonces, timestamps, or sequence numbers  
* Availability: design fallback channels and retries  

---

## Latest Techniques & Terms

* Key Wrapping (RFC 3394): standardized AES-based key encryption  
* WKD (Web Key Directory): auto-discover public keys in email systems  
* DARE (Dynamic Access Revocation Exchange): instant revocation of distributed keys  
* OPC UA Certificate Management: secure machine-to-machine key exchange  
* Continuous Key Delivery: streaming session keys for real-time applications  

---
## Distribution Mechanisms

### KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism)

What  
KEM is a hybrid encryption primitive that uses asymmetric keys to securely ‚Äúencapsulate‚Äù a randomly generated symmetric key. The recipient uses their private key to ‚Äúdecapsulate‚Äù and recover the symmetric key without exposing it in transit.

How  
1. Encapsulate:  
   * Sender generates a random data-encryption key (DEK).  
   * DEK is encrypted (wrapped) under the receiver‚Äôs public key, producing a ciphertext capsule.  
   * Sender transmits the capsule plus any associated header data.  
2. Decapsulate:  
   * Receiver uses their private key to decrypt the capsule.  
   * DEK is recovered in its original form, ready for bulk encryption/decryption.

**Use Cases:**  
* TLS hybrid handshake (ECDH-KEM variants)  
* Email encryption with ECIES or RSA-KEM  
* Post-quantum KEMs (e.g., Kyber) in emerging protocols  

---

### KEX (Key Exchange)

What  
KEX is an interactive protocol allowing two parties to agree on a shared secret key over an insecure channel, without directly sending the secret itself.

How  
1. Parameter Setup:  
   * Both parties agree on public domain parameters (e.g., prime p and generator g for DH, or curve parameters for ECDH).  
2. Ephemeral Key Generation:  
   * Each party generates a private key (a random integer) and computes its public counterpart.  
3. Exchange:  
   * Parties exchange their public values.  
4. Shared Secret Computation:  
   * Each party uses their private key and the other party‚Äôs public value to compute the same shared secret.  
5. Derive Symmetric Keys:  
   * Apply a KDF (e.g., HKDF) to the shared secret to produce session keys for encryption and MAC.

**Use Cases:**  
* Classic Diffie-Hellman in VPNs and SSH  
* Elliptic-curve ECDH in TLS and secure messaging  
* Ephemeral DH for forward secrecy  

---

### KSX (Key Synchronization Exchange)

What  
KSX replicates symmetric keys or key versions across multiple nodes in real time, ensuring all replicas maintain the same key state.

How  
* Uses a publish-subscribe or multi-master replication model.  
* On key creation or rotation, the originator publishes the new key or version.  
* Subscribers receive updates automatically and replace their local copy.  

**Use Cases:**  
* Geo-redundant database clusters with transparent data encryption  
* Distributed cache encryption (Redis, Memcached)  

---

### KMX (Key Management eXchange)

What  
KMX is a protocol/API standard for transferring cryptographic keys, key metadata, and lifecycle commands between heterogeneous KMS instances.

How  
* Defines operations for ‚ÄúExportKey,‚Äù ‚ÄúImportKey,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSynchronizeKey.‚Äù  
* Often built on KMIP or vendor-specific extensions.  
* Ensures secure transport (TLS/mTLS) and mutual authentication between KMS endpoints.  

**Use Cases:**  
* Multi-cloud or hybrid deployments requiring centralized key policies  
* KMS migration or failover scenarios where keys must move between providers  
---

## Advantages & Disadvantages

**Advantages**  
* Automated protocols scale to millions of endpoints  
* Out-of-band transfers minimize attack surface during transit  
* API-based delivery integrates with CI/CD and orchestration  

**Disadvantages**  
* Manual methods don‚Äôt scale and risk human error  
* KEX protocols require initial trust establishment (PKI bootstrap)  
* Cloud APIs introduce third-party trust dependencies  

---

## Implementation Tips & Prerequisites

* Establish a trust anchor (root CA or hardware root of trust) first  
* Use TLS or secure channels for API-based distribution  
* Protect distribution endpoints with strong authentication (mTLS, HSM seals)  
* Automate retries and monitoring for delivery failures  
* Implement immediate revocation paths for compromised keys

### Key Destruction  

Key Destruction is the process of completely and irreversibly removing cryptographic key material from all storage and backup locations so that it cannot be recovered or misused.

---

**Objectives**  

* Prevent any future use of retired, expired, or compromised keys  
* Eliminate residual key data that could be extracted by attackers  
* Satisfy regulatory and compliance mandates for secure disposal  

---  

#### When to Destroy  

* At scheduled end-of-life or after key rotation/renewal  
* Immediately upon detection of compromise or suspected leakage  
* Following migration to new algorithms or platforms  
* During decommissioning of hardware devices or services  

---  

#### Destruction Techniques  

* Memory Zeroization  
  - Overwrite RAM buffers or CPU registers holding the key material  
  - Use secure coding practices to invoke constant-time zero routines  
* Cryptographic Erasure  
  - Delete or revoke the wrapping key so that wrapped keys become unrecoverable  
* Disk/Storage Wipe  
  - Overwrite disk sectors or use secure erase commands (e.g., ATA Secure Erase)  
  - Apply NIST SP 800-88 media sanitization guidelines for SSD/HDD  
* Degaussing & Physical Destruction  
  - Demagnetize storage media for magnetic disks  
  - Shred or incinerate physical tokens, smartcards, or HSM modules  
* Hardware Reset Commands  
  - Invoke secure-erase or factory-reset features in TPMs, HSMs, and secure elements  

---  

#### Verification & Auditing  

* Log every destruction event with key identifiers and timestamps  
* Perform post-wipe validation scans or checksum comparisons  
* Include destruction proofs or certificates when required by policy  

---  

#### Implementation Tips  

* Automate destruction workflows in your Key Management Service (KMS) or vault  
* Integrate zeroization routines in application shutdown paths  
* Train operations teams on hardware-based disposal procedures  
* Retain only metadata (key IDs, usage logs) for audit and forensics, never the key bits themselves  
* Regularly review and test destruction processes as part of your security posture
