# Key
Cryptographic Key is a string of bits that is used to encrypt and decrypt data.
**Purpose**

### Sources of Entropy

| Source            | Description                                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TRNG (True RNG)   | Hardware-based randomness from physical phenomena (e.g., electronic noise) |
| PRNG (Pseudo RNG) | Software generator seeded by entropy to produce streams of random bits   |
| QRNG (Quantum RNG)| Quantum effects (e.g., photon behavior) supplying extremely high entropy |
| OS Facilities     | Built-in system calls (`/dev/random`, `getrandom()`, CryptGenRandom)     |

**Applications:**  
1. Seeding CSPRNGs for key material  
2. Generating nonces and salts in protocols  
3. Creating session keys in secure channels  

---

### Symmetric Key Generation

1. Gather sufficient entropy from TRNG or OS facilities.  
2. Seed a cryptographically secure PRNG (CSPRNG).  
3. Read N random bytes (e.g., 16 bytes for AES-128, 32 bytes for AES-256).  
4. Optionally wrap or encrypt the raw key (key-wrapping) before storage.  

| Algorithm  | Description                                  |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| AES Key    | Read 128/192/256 random bits directly       |
| ChaCha20   | Read 256 bits for ChaCha20 symmetric key    |

**Applications:**

- Securing communication sessions (TLS, VPN)  

---

### Asymmetric Key Generation

1. Collect high-quality entropy as above.  
2. Run the key algorithm:  
   - **RSA**: Pick two large random primes, compute n = p¬∑q, derive e/d exponents.  
   - **ECC**: Choose a random integer d in [1, n‚Äì1], compute public point Q = d¬∑G.  
3. Package keys in standard formats (PKCS#8, X.509, OpenSSH).  
4. Store private keys in secure vaults (HSM/TPM) and publish public keys or certificates.

| Algorithm     | Key Material Generated                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|

## Storage Methods

| Method                        | Description                                                                 | Examples                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Software-Based Key Vaults     | Encrypted key stores managed by software services                           | HashiCorp Vault; Google Secret Manager     |
| Cloud Key Management Services | Managed services exposing key APIs with optional HSM backing                | AWS KMS; Azure Key Vault                   |
| Hardware Security Modules     | Dedicated hardware appliances and chips that generate and securely hold keys | HSM appliances; TPM chips                  |
| Processor-Isolated Enclaves   | CPU-enforced memory regions that protect keys from the OS and applications   | Intel SGX; ARM TrustZone                   |
| Ephemeral In-Memory Storage   | Session or ephemeral keys held in RAM or CPU registers, cleared on shutdown  | TLS session keys; ephemeral ECDH keys      |
| Threshold Cryptography        | Splits keys into shares and reconstructs them in memory when needed         | Shamir Secret Sharing; MPC protocols       |


---

## Memory & Cache Considerations

Keys in application memory and CPU caches/registers enable high-performance operations but are vulnerable if the host OS or hardware is compromised.  

To mitigate this risk:  

* Lock pages in RAM (e.g., `mlock`) to prevent swapping to disk  
* Use constant-time implementations to avoid cache-timing side-channels  
* Zero-ize buffers immediately after use to remove remnants  

Secure enclaves (SGX, TrustZone) provide hardware-enforced isolation so keys never leave protected memory regions, even if the OS is compromised.

---

## Key Backup & Recovery

Regularly back up encrypted key blobs (wrapped by a master key) to off-site or multi-region storage.  

Use secret-sharing to split backup keys across trustees or secure locations.  

Automate recovery drills to verify that keys can be restored under disaster scenarios.

---

## Key Access & Authorization

Enforce RBAC or ABAC policies to limit who can generate, read, wrap, or export keys.  

Log every key operation (generate, encrypt/decrypt, rotate, destroy) for audit and compliance.  

Use short-lived session keys derived from long-term master keys via HKDF to reduce long-term exposure.

---

## Advantages & Disadvantages

**Advantages**  
* Centralized vaults simplify policy enforcement and auditing  
* Hardware modules and enclaves resist software-level attacks  
* In-memory storage supports low-latency operations  

**Disadvantages**  
* Hardware modules add cost and integration complexity  
* In-memory keys risk leakage if the host is compromised  
* Vaultless or enclave solutions can be hard to scale across diverse environments

---

## Implementation Tips & Prerequisites

* Classify keys by sensitivity and choose storage accordingly (session vs. root keys)  
* For in-memory keys, enforce strict page locking and immediate zero-ization on release  
* Integrate Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or TPM for high-value key protection  
* Leverage managed KMS offerings for automated rotation, audit logging, and access control  
* Ensure code running in secure enclaves is minimal and audited to reduce attack surface
