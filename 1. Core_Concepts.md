# Confidentiality
 
- Protection of information so that only authorized users can access it.(ensures user Identification & Authentication)  
- Critical for military, government, buisnesses  

## Confidentiality Models
1. Bell-LaPadula Model : Uses security levels for users and data to enforce access.  
2. Access Control Model: Defines Which user can perform operations on which object(data).

## Types Of Confidentiality
1. Data confidentiality: Protect stored data(using encyprition, access control)  
2. Network Confidentiality: Protect transmitted data (SSl/TLS)  
3. End-to-end Confidentiality: Secure communtication between endpoints(End-to-End Confidentiality).  
4. Application confidentiality: Secure sensitive information processed by applications.  
5. Disk/file confidentiality: Protect Stored data on physical media.

## Common Techniques
1. Encyprition  
2. Access control  
3. User Authentication  
4. Data Masking (hide sensitive data)  
5. VPNs  
6. Secure File Transfer (SFTP)

## Challenges/Issues
1. Insider Threats, cyberattacks(brute force attacks,  
2. Human error, technical failure  
3. Weak Security measures  
4. Legal and regulatory requirements
