1. Write a program to perform encryption and decryption using Caesar cipher
 (substitutional cipher).
 2. Write a program to perform encryption and decryption using Rail Fence Cipher
 (transpositional cipher)
 3. Write a Python program that defines a function and takes a password string as input and
 returns its SHA-256 hashed representation as a hexadecimal string.
 4. Write a Python program that reads a file containing a list of usernames and passwords,
 one pair per line (separated by a comma). It checks each password to see if it has been
 leaked in a data breach. You can use the "Have I Been Pwned" API
 (https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) to check if a password has been leaked.
 5. Write a Python program that generates a password using a random combination of
 words from a dictionary file.

 9. Students needs to explore the requirements of the Data Protection Regulations and
 develop a plan for ensuring compliance with the regulation.
 10. Students needs to explore ethical considerations in data privacy, such as the balance
